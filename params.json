I have to extract the icon every time when you do refresh. for those who has thousands APKs in one folder, please leave a message or drop a mail let me know how critical the situation is, I would like to think about creating a file cache in your temp folder for each icon.\r\n * *Q:*Cannot delete the dll after uninstall?\r\n * *A:* Kill the explorer and restart it. The latest release (v2.3) solved this, basically it caused by some process handler leak. But in case, I left a restart_explorer.bat in v2.3 package\r\n * *Q:*How often this project got updated?\r\n * *A:* it's a home-brew project, and I cannot guarantee frequently update, let me know if you have idea or you want to help.\r\n * *Q:*How to connect phone to adb via wifi?\r\n * *A:* I don't think it's a question for now, search wireless ADB in google play\r\n * *Q:*Cannot see icon when phone connected as media device\r\n * *A:* Basically the shell extension needs to read your app file as file, so you have to set your phone as MSD(Massive Storage Device, USB device mode), at least for now. For some brand, you need to install driver to enable ADB. \r\n\r\n==2013-9-8 ==\r\n\r\nSo surprise you guys still here, I will restart this small project soon...\r\nSo on the list:\r\n * add google play menu\r\n * permission details.\r\n * etc...\r\n\r\n==2011-9-1 v2.1==\r\n\r\nIf you find the explorer no response for long time, please re-plug in your device and retry.
